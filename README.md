ServoStock
==========

This is the repository for the bowler enabled, closed loop controlled 3d printer. This repository is for all of the code for the printer.

I edited this as part of my open Issue "ServoStock · Check out the GIT repo and close this issue through a commit."

Sorry for the delay, I just realized I had an open issue recently and had to figure out 
eclipse and Git. #4 Jared Heiser
